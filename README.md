# Exit Game Puzzle Solver

## Project Overview

This project was born out of a challenging experience while playing an exit game. One of the puzzles required finding
the last digit for a combination that started with the piece (1,3). The puzzle proved to be quite the headache when
attempted manually, prompting me to come up with an automated solution - thus, this Python script was born.

## How It Works

This Python script simplifies the process of solving exit game puzzles that involve number combinations. Specifically,
it focuses on puzzles that require finding the last digit of a sequence, given the first two numbers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need:

- Python 3.7 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Andree37/exit-domino-finder.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd exit-domino-finder

### Usage

To use the script, run the following command in the terminal:

`python domino_solver.py [input sequence]`

Replace [input sequence] with your puzzle sequence. For example:

`python domino_solver.py 1 3`

If no input is given, the default initial piece will be `(1,3)`.
